# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

# Resizable Rectangle Project

This project consists of a React frontend and an ASP.NET Core backend for displaying and resizing a rectangle.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)
- .NET SDK (v6.0 or later)

## Debugging Information

When debugging this project, keep the following points in mind:

1. **Backend API**: The frontend expects the backend API to be running on `https://localhost:5001`. Make sure your backend is running and accessible at this address.

2. **CORS**: If you encounter CORS issues, ensure that the backend is properly configured to allow requests from the frontend origin ( `http://localhost:3000`).

3. **Rectangle Dimensions**: The initial rectangle dimensions are loaded from a JSON file on the backend. If you're not seeing the correct initial dimensions, check the `data/rectangle.json` file in the backend project.

4. **Resizing Validation**: The backend implements a 10-second delay and validates that the width doesn't exceed the height.

5. **Cancellation of Updates**: The frontend uses the `AbortController` API to cancel ongoing update requests when a new resize operation starts.
